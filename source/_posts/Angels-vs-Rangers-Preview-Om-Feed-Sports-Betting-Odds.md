#  Angels Lose Again to Rangers After shaky outing by Richards

The Angels were looking to get back on track after a tough lost to the Astros. But they couldn't get it done against the Rangers, losing 2-1. The game was especially frustrating for Garrett Richards, who had a shaky outing.

Richards started the game off strong, striking out the first two batters he faced. But in the second inning things went downhill. He allowed a home run to Rougned Odor, and then gave up another run later in the inning. He was pulled from the game after 4 innings, having allowed 3 hits and 3 runs.

It was a disappointing start for Richards, who had been doing well lately. In his last four starts he had only given up 2 earned runs total. This loss brings his record to 7-8 for the season.

The Angels will hopefully be able to turn things around in their next game against the Blue Jays.

#  How the Los Angeles Angels can make a deep playoff run

The Los Angeles Angels surprised the baseball world last season by winning 80 games and just missing out on the playoffs. With Mike Trout leading the way, the Angels should be poised for a deep playoff run in 2019.

There are a few key things the Angels need to do in order to make a deep playoff run. First, they need to stay healthy. The Angels were extremely fortunate last season in that they avoided any major injuries. This season, they’ll need all of their top players to be healthy in order to make a serious run at the playoffs.

Second, the Angels will need better starting pitching. Last season, their starters had an ERA of 4.42, which was 21st in baseball. In order to make it deep into the playoffs, they’ll need their starters to pitch better than that.

Third, the Angels will need better bullpen pitching. Their bullpen had an ERA of 4.49 last year, which was 23rd in baseball. They’ll need their bullpen pitchers to step up and keep games close late in the game.

If the Angels can manage to stay healthy and improve their starting pitching and bullpen pitching, they have a good chance of making a deep playoff run this year.
