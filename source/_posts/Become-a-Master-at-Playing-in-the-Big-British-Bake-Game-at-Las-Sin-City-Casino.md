#  Become a Master at Playing in the Big British Bake Game at Las Sin City Casino

The first step is to learn the basic rules of the game. The Big British Bake is a game of chance played with a single deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to beat the banker by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going bust.

Each player is dealt two cards face up and the banker is dealt one card face down. The player then has the option to hit (draw another card) or stand (end their turn). If the player beats the bankers total, they win even money on their bet. If they lose, they lose their bet.

The game progresses as follows:

- After all players have had their turn, the banker reveals their card.
- If the banker's card is higher than the players' combined total, the banker takes all bets.
- If the banker's card is lower than the players' combined total, the players share any bets placed equally between them.
- If there is a tie, the banker wins.

Knowing when to hit and when to stand can be crucial in winning at this game - so it's important to practice until you feel confident in your decision making. Start off by betting low amounts and increase your stakes once you're comfortable with the rules and how the game plays out.
