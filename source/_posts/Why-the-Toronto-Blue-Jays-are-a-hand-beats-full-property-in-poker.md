#  When to bluff with a hand beats full property in poker

In poker, bluffing is a key part of the game. It's what keeps players guessing, and can often result in big pots. But when should you bluff? And when is it better to just fold your hand?

One time you might want to bluff is when you have a hand that's beaten full of properties. For example, let's say you're holding two pair - two kings and two queens - and the flop comes with three more queens. You're probably not going to want to try and bluff anyone out of the pot at this point! Your hand is strong, and there's no need to risk your chips.

However, if the flop comes with three different suits, your two pair might not be as strong. In this case, it might be worth trying to bluff someone into folding their hand. Even if you don't end up winning the pot, you might at least win back some of your lost chips.

Bottom line: know when to hold 'em and know when to bluff 'em! If you have a strong hand, then by all means don't bluff. But if your hand is weaker than average, then go ahead and put some pressure on your opponents by bluffing them out of the pot.
