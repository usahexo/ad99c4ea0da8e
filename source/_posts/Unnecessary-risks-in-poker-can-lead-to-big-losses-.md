#  Unnecessary risks in poker can lead to big losses 
It can be easy to get caught up in the excitement of poker and make careless mistakes that can lead to big losses. Here are three examples of unnecessary risks that can cost you dearly:

1. Playing too many hands 
If you're playing more hands than you should be, you're increasing your chances of making a mistake. In addition, playing too many hands can lead to costly confrontations with stronger players. Play tight and only enter into hands when the odds are in your favour.

2. FOLDING when you should be betting 
Many inexperienced poker players fold too early, especially when they've got a good hand. If you're not confident in your ability to outplay your opponents post-flop, then it's usually better to bet and see what happens. Remember - it's better to lose a small amount than fold and lose everything.

3. OVERCOMPETING 
Sometimes players try too hard to make a big show and end up losing more money than they should. Remember - slow and steady often wins the race in poker. Playing overly aggressive can lead to costly mistakes that give your opponents an edge.

#  Why you should never play certain hands in poker 

There are some hands in poker that you should never play, no matter what the situation. These hands include:

-Ace of clubs and Ace of spades (other aces are playable)
-2 clubs and 2 spades (other low pairs are playable)
-7 or lower offsuit (any other card is playable)

#  When not to play your hand in poker 

In poker, there are always risks and rewards for playing your hand. You put yourself at risk by playing, and you may or may not hit the reward you are seeking. In some cases, it is simply better to fold and preserve your chips rather than risk them all on an un-winning hand. Here are four scenarios in which it might be best not to play your cards:

1) You hold a weak hand: If you have a weak hand, it is often best to fold instead of risking further losses. A weak hand will almost always lose against a stronger hand, so there is little point in continuing to play.

2) The pot is too large: If the pot has gotten too large, it may be wiser to fold than to keep betting. The odds of hitting your desired hand decrease as the pot size increases, so it might be wise to cut your losses and move on.

3) You are up against a very strong player: If you are playing against a very strong player, it may be best to fold rather than risk losing even more chips. A skilled player will likely be able to reading your plays and exploit any weaknesses, so folding may be the best option.

4) The odds are against you: If the odds of winning are not in your favor, folding is often the best option. There is no sense in risking additional chips when the likelihood of winning is low.

#  Playing the wrong hands in poker can be costly 

Especially when playing in a tournament setting, playing the wrong hands can end up costing you a lot of money. In fact, even in cash games you can lose a significant amount of money by playing the wrong hands.

There are a few different types of hands that you should almost never play in poker, no matter what the situation is. The first is called “suited connectors”. These are hands like 8-9 or 10-J, which are playable only if there is a lot of early action and you can get them in cheap. Otherwise, they are just too risky.

Another type of hand that you should avoid playing is any two suited cards. Even if one of your hearts is facing up on the flop, it’s usually not worth it to continue playing this hand. The reason is that you will often end up with a weak hand that won’t win many pots, and will therefore lose money in the long run.

 Finally, you should also stay away from any big pairs like kings or aces. These hands may be strong preflop, but they become much weaker once there is more than one player involved in the hand. In general, you’re better off folding these hands and waiting for something better to come along.

#  How to avoid playing bad hands in poker

Bad poker hands can be costly, both in terms of the money you lose and the opportunity cost of not playing better hands. It's important to know how to avoid playing bad hands, so that you can focus on playing the best possible hands and increase your chances of winning.

The first step is to identify which hands are bad. Generally, any hand that doesn't have at least a pair is a bad hand. If your hand doesn't have any kind of scoring combination, it's almost certainly a bad hand. There are some exceptions - for example, if you're playing a game like Omaha Hi-Lo, you may want to hold onto some low-value hands - but in general, if your hand doesn't have a pair or better, it's a bad hand.

Another important factor to consider is your position at the table. In general, you'll want to be more aggressive with your hands when you're in early position (ie. when you're one of the first players to act) and play more passively when you're in later position (ie. when you have to wait for others to act before you). This is because there's more information available about what other players are holding when you're in later position, so it's easier to make informed decisions about whether or not to fold.

Knowing when not to play a hand is just as important as knowing which hands are worth playing. If there's even a small chance that your hand might be beaten by one of your opponents, it's usually wise to fold and save yourself from making a mistake. Winning poker isn't always about playing the best possible hand - sometimes it's more important to cut your losses and walk away from a situation where you don't have an edge.

By following these tips, you'll be able to reduce the number of bad hands you play and improve your chances of winning at poker.
