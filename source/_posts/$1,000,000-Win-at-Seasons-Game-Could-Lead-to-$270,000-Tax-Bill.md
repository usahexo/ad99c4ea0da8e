#  $1,000,000 Win at Seasons Game Could Lead to $270,000 Tax Bill

The IRS requires you to report gambling winnings as taxable income. So, if you hit it big at a Seasons game and take home $1 million, you can expect to pay about $270,000 in taxes.

Gambling income is generally reported on line 21 of your federal Form 1040. This line includes not only lottery and casino winnings but also income from wagers and the fair market value of prizes you receive (like a new car).

Casino winnings are taxable up to the amount you won minus the amount you wagered. So, if you played $10 and won $100, only the $90 difference would be taxed. However, any winnings above $599 are subject to a mandatory 25% federal withholding tax.

For state taxes, Nevada, New Jersey, and South Dakota have no state-level taxes on gambling winnings. Delaware levies a tax of between 2.2% and 8.5% depending on the amount of your winnings. All other states have their own tax brackets which could range anywhere from 0% to 12%.

So, if you hit it big at Seasons game in Delaware and take home a million dollars, you can expect to pay about $270,000 in combined federal and state taxes.
