#  Schumash Casino Hotel 0 – 5 All Win FC

The Schumash Casino Hotel in Santa Barbara was the site of an amazing exhibition match between 0 – 5 All Win FC and the Santa Barbara Condors. The 0 – 5 All Win FC are a team of young, up and coming Brazilian soccer stars who have been making a name for themselves all over Europe. The Santa Barbara Condors are an American amateur soccer team whose players range in age from 18 to 70.

The match started out as most exhibition matches do, with both teams feeling each other out and trying to gain an advantage. The first goal of the match didn’t come until the 31st minute when one of the Brazilian players blasted a shot past the Condor’s goalie. The second goal came just two minutes later when another Brazilian player found himself in acres of space in front of the Condor’s net and put the ball away.

The third goal didn’t come until near halftime when one of the Brazilian players made a beautiful run down the right side of the field before slotting the ball home. On top of that, he also managed to set up teammate for the fourth goal early in the second half. The fifth and final goal of the match came a few minutes later when yet another Brazilian found himself in alone in front of the net and easily put it away.

In spite of being outclassed by a much better team, the Santa Barbara Condors never gave up and continued to fight hard until the final whistle blew. All in all, it was an amazing display by 0 – 5 All Win FC and a great experience for everyone involved.
