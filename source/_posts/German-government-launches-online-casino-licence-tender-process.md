#  German government launches online casino licence tender process

On Monday, the German government announced the launch of an online casino licence tender process. The tender process is being overseen by the Federal Ministry of the Interior.

The move comes as Germany looks to legalize and regulate the country’s burgeoning online casino market. The government is hoping that the introduction of a formal licensing process will help to better control and monitor the industry.

Interested operators can now apply for one of four licences that are up for grabs. These licences will allow operators to offer their services to German players from within the country.

The tender process will be open for submissions until January 11th, 2019. Operators who are interested in applying can find more information on the Federal Ministry of the Interior’s website.

So far, there has been a mixed reaction to Germany’s plans to legalize online casinos. On the one hand, proponents of legalization argue that it will bring much-needed jobs and investment to the country. On the other hand, opponents claim that it could lead to increased crime and gambling addiction rates.

It remains to be seen how things will play out in Germany’s online casino market. However, with so much money at stake, it is sure to be a topic of heated discussion in the months ahead.

#  How to get the online casino license Goehte 
Determining the jurisdiction of the casino is a critical step for those seeking to obtain an online gambling license. Malta, Alderney, Gibraltar and Isle of Man are popular options, but there are many other reputable jurisdictions. Types of casino licenses 
There are three types of casino licenses:

- A full license authorizes the licensee to provide all forms of gambling that are legal in the jurisdiction.
- A restricted license allows the licensee to offer specific types of gambling. This might be limited to certain games or betting options.
- A provisional license is for new operators and is usually valid for a year. It allows the licensee to operate while their full application is being considered.

Requirements for a casino license 
In order to obtain a casino license, the applicant must meet certain requirements. These vary by jurisdiction, but may include:
- The applicant must be of good character with a clean criminal record.
- The applicant must have experience in the gambling industry or in a related field.
- The proposed casino must meet certain financial requirements. This includes having adequate funds to cover any potential losses.
- The casino must have systems in place to prevent money laundering and fraud.

#  Online casino licences: Germany draws up strict new rules 

The German government is drawing up strict new rules for online casino licences, in a bid to crackdown on illegal gambling and money laundering.

Under the proposed rules, operators will have to be licensed in Germany in order to offer their services to German players. Licences will only be granted to companies that can meet strict requirements, including a ban on advertising and a limit on the number of licences available.

The government says the new rules are needed to ensure that German players have a safe and legal online gambling experience, and to protect them from fraud and money laundering.

Opposition politicians have criticised the plans, saying they will drive casinos offshore and cost the government millions of euros in lost revenue. However, the government is adamant that the new rules are necessary for the protection of consumers.

It remains to be seen how effective the new rules will be in curbing illegal gambling activity in Germany. However, they are likely to lead to increased regulation of the online casino industry in Germany, and could pave the way for similar laws in other European countries.

#  What is needed to obtain an online casino license in Germany? 

There are various things that are necessary in order to obtain an online casino license in Germany. The first thing that is needed is a good understanding of the German gambling law. This will help to ensure that the casino is operating within the legal framework. In addition, a detailed business plan must be submitted, as well as a comprehensive description of the casino’s operations. Furthermore, a detailed risk assessment must be conducted in order to identify and mitigate any risks associated with the casino. The final requirement is the submission of financial statements, which must be audited by an independent auditor.

#  Germany opens up online casino market, but applicants must meet tough criteria

#

Germany has announced that it will be opening up its online casino market to new applicants, but these applicants will have to meet tough criteria in order to be approved. The news was confirmed by the Federal Ministry of the Interior earlier this week, with a statement saying that the government is looking for 'secure and reliable providers' who can offer a 'high-quality product'.

In order to be eligible for a license, providers must have a good track record when it comes to combating money laundering and fraud, as well as being able to demonstrate a commitment to social responsibility. In addition, they must also have their own gaming software and systems in place, as well as secure payment methods.

#

The move is seen as an attempt by the German government to crackdown on illegal gambling operations and protect consumers. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of unlicensed and unregulated casinos operating in Germany, many of which are believed to be run by organized crime syndicates.

Meanwhile, licensed operators will be able to offer their services to German players from within the country from July 2019. This follows a recent ruling by the European Court of Justice that overturned a ban on online gambling put in place by the German government in 2006.
