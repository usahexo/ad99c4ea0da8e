#  How to Ban Yourself from Online Gambling in Less Than Five Minutes

For some people, the lure of online gambling can be irresistible. If you’re one of those people, or know someone who is, you may be interested in learning how to ban yourself from online gambling in less than five minutes.

The first step is to go to the settings page for your online gambling account and look for the self-exclusion option. This will vary depending on the site you’re using, but it will typically be under a “privacy” or “security” tab.

Once you’ve found the self-exclusion option, select it and follow the instructions. You may have to input your date of birth and answer a few other questions.

After that, your account will be temporarily or permanently banned from online gambling. Depending on the site, you may also be banned from accessing your account via any device or computer.

It’s important to keep in mind that self-exclusion doesn’t mean you can never gamble again – it just means you can’t do so on that specific site. If you want to gamble again, you’ll need to contact the site and ask them to lift the ban.

If you think someone you know may have a problem with online gambling, there are several things you can do to help them:

– Talk to them about your concerns and offer your support.

– Encourage them to seek help from a professional gambler addiction service.

– Help them create a budget and stick to it.

– Remove all credit and debit cards associated with their online gambling accounts.

#  Make Yourself Banned from Online Gambling in Under 60 Seconds

Gambling online is one of the favorite pastimes of people all over the world. Unfortunately, for a select few, this pastime can quickly turn into a costly addiction. If you find yourself struggling with an online gambling addiction, you may want to consider banning yourself from online gambling altogether.

How to ban yourself from online gambling

The first step in banning yourself from online gambling is to determine how much you spend on it each month. Once you have that number, take 2/3 of it and subtract it from your monthly budget. This is the amount that you will need to live off of each month and should not be used for online gambling.

The next step is to delete all of your online gambling accounts. This includes accounts with casinos, sportsbooks, and poker sites. If you have any credit or debit cards connected to these accounts, be sure to cancel them as well. Finally, remove all links to gambling websites from your internet browser and any other devices that you use to gamble online.

If you find that you are struggling to stay away from online gambling, even after implementing these steps, consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group specifically for people with online gambling addictions.
