#  What is the meaning of Kubet?

The word kubet has no definitive meaning, as it is purely a made-up word. Some say that it might be derived from the words 'kubernetes' and 'pet', with kubernetes meaning 'to steer or govern' and pet meaning 'a domesticated animal kept as a companion'. This could mean that kubet would refer to a creature that is both loved and controlled. Others believe that the word was created by someone who simply enjoyed the sound of it, with no real meaning behind it.
