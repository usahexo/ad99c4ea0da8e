#  Texas Legalizes All Forms of Gambling

The state of Texas has voted to legalize all forms of gambling, including casino games, sports betting, and lotteries. This makes Texas the latest in a growing number of states to legalize some or all forms of gambling.

Supporters of gambling argue that it is a harmless way to pass the time and can be a source of revenue for the government. They also argue that it is no different than other forms of entertainment, such as movies or golf.

Critics of gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. They also argue that it can have negative social consequences, such as increased crime rates and decreased economic productivity.

Despite the criticism, gambling continues to grow in popularity. In the United States, gambling is now legal in 41 states. And worldwide, gambling revenues totaled $406 billion in 2017, up from $384 billion in 2016.

#  Texas Finally Allows Slot Machines

Texas has finally legalized slot machines, making it the 46th state to do so. This comes as a big relief to casino operators and players alike, who have been pushing for the change for years.

The new law will go into effect on September 1st and will allow casinos in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin to offer slot machines. Operators must pay a $125 million license fee and will be able to keep 25% of gross gaming revenue.

Supporters of the change say that it will bring in much-needed revenue to the state. Opponents argue that it will lead to gambling addiction and other social problems.

Either way, it looks like slot machines are coming to Texas casinos this fall!

#  Texas Now Has Casinos!

In November of 2018, Texas voters passed a referendum legalizing casinos in the state. This has been a long time coming; proponents of casino gambling have argued for its legalization for years. Now that it is finally legal, what does this mean for Texas?

The first thing to note is that not every part of Texas will have casinos. The referendum allows for up to 10 “destination resort” casinos, which will be built in counties that border other states with casinos (or in counties with a population of at least 1 million people). So far, only two counties have said they will apply for a license: Bexar (which includes San Antonio) and Tarrant (which includes Fort Worth).

So what will these casinos be like? They will offer gaming such as slot machines and table games, as well as restaurants, hotels, and retail outlets. But don’t expect them to look like Vegas-style casinos – the Texas gambling commission has said that they should be “more like resorts than gaming halls.”

One big question is how this will affect the state’s lottery. Currently, the lottery is a major source of revenue for the state – in fact, it accounts for about 5% of the state’s total annual revenue. Some people are concerned that legalized casino gambling could cannibalize the lottery’s profits. Time will tell how this plays out.

In any case, it’s clear that legalized casino gambling is a big change for Texas. There are sure to be both winners and losers as the industry ramps up. So far, there are no firm plans for when the first casino will open; officials say it could be anywhere from two to five years. But one thing is for sure: Texas is now a player in the multi-billion dollar casino industry!

#  Poker Games and Bingo Allowed in Texas

Governor Greg Abbott has singed a bill into law that will allow the playing of bingo and poker games in Texas. The new law goes into effect on September 1, 2019 and will allow charities to host the games as a way to raise money.

Up until now, Texas has been one of only five states in the US that does not allow some form of bingo. The change in the law is expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue to charities across the state.

Poker games will also be allowed, with players able to buy-in for up to $1,000. The Texas Gaming Commission will be responsible for licensing and regulating the new games.
