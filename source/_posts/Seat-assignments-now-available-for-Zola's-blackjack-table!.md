In this article, we'll teach you the basics of blackjack so that you can start playing with confidence.

Blackjack is a popular casino game that is played with cards. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over.

The game is played with a deck of 52 cards, which are divided equally between the player and the dealer. The player is dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.

The player's aim is to get as close to 21 as possible by adding together the value of their two cards. The ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what will make the most advantageous hand for the player. Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, and any other card (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points.

If the player's first two cards add up to 21 or less, they have a "blackjack" and win automatically, unless the dealer has a blackjack too (in which case it's a push). If the player's total exceeds 21 (i.e. they bust), they lose automatically.

If the player's first two cards add up to more than 21, they have several options: 
- They can "stand" and keep those cards (this means that they are happy with their total and don't want any more cards). 
- They can ask for another card ("hit"). 
- If they have hit twice already, they can "double down" which means that they double their bet and are given just one more card. 
- If they have hit three times already, they can "split" their hand into two separate hands (provided both hands have matching rank), doubling their bet in the process. 
The dealer then takes their own turn, flipping over their second card and following the same rules as above - trying to get as close to 21 as possible while not going over. When both players have finished playing their hands, whoever has closest to 21 wins!

Blackjack is a popular casino game that is easy to learn but can be complicated to master. The object of the game is to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player bets against the dealer, not against other players.

The game begins with the player placing their bet in the betting circle. The dealer will then give each player two cards face up. One of the dealer's cards is face down. After all the players have received their cards, the dealer will turn over their hidden card.

If the player's total is closer to 21 than the dealer's total, they win and are paid out even money on their bet plus any additional winnings based on the value of their hand (e.g., a blackjack pays out 3:2). If the dealer beats the player, they lose their bet amount. If the player and dealer have the same total, it is called a push and no one wins or loses money.

There are a number of different ways to beat the dealer and improve your chances of winning, including split bets, double down bets, and insurance bets. For more information on blackjack strategy, check out our handy guide below.
