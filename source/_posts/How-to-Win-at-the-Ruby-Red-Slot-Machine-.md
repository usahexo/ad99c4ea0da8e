How to Play Ruby Red

The first thing you need to do before playing Ruby Red is decide how much money you want to wager. You can choose from betting denominations of $0.01, $0.02, $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $1, or $5 per spin. Once you’ve chosen your bet amount, it’s time to hit the “spin” button and start playing!

The object of the game is to match three or more symbols on a payline in order to win prizes. The symbols in Ruby Red are all gemstones, with different values depending on how rare they are. The most common symbol is the ruby, which pays out 3x your bet amount for three symbols on a payline. Other valuable gems include sapphires (10x), emeralds (25x), and diamonds (100x). In addition, there is a wild symbol that can substitute for any other symbol in order to create winning combos.

However, this doesn’t mean that lower bets aren’t worth playing; in fact, some of the biggest payouts in the game come from hitting three ruby symbols on a single line when betting only $0.01 per spin!
