      		<h1 id="Study-Shows-Nearly-One-Third-of-NCAA-Athletes-Engage-in-Gambling-on-Games"><a href="#Study-Shows-Nearly-One-Third-of-NCAA-Athletes-Engage-in-Gambling-on-Games" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Nearly One-Third of NCAA Athletes Engage in Gambling on Games"></a>Study Shows Nearly One-Third of NCAA Athletes Engage in Gambling on Games</h1><p>A recent study by the University of Michigan has found that nearly one-third of NCAA athletes engage in some form of gambling on college sporting events. The study, which surveyed nearly 1,000 current and former Division I student-athletes, found that 32 percent of participants had gambled on games in the past.</p>
<p>The gambling activities included in the study ranged from simple wagers between friends to more sophisticated forms of sports betting. In addition, the study also found that a majority of those who gambled on games did so illegally.</p>
<p>While there is no evidence that gambling has had a negative impact on the academic performance of student-athletes, the study’s authors cautioned that it could create a conflict of interest for athletes who have something at stake financially in the outcome of a game. They also noted that such activities could lead to further problems like match-fixing and corruption.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that concerns have been raised about gambling among college athletes. In 2013, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) issued a report that found almost one in ten Division I men’s basketball players had engaged in some form of sports betting over the previous year.</p>
<p>The NCAA has since taken steps to address this issue, including developing a program called “Integrity 101: Betting on College Sports.” The program is designed to educate student-athletes about the dangers associated with gambling and to provide them with resources to help them avoid problems related to betting.</p>
<h1 id="Athlete-Gambling-Linked-to-Lower-Grade-Point-Averages"><a href="#Athlete-Gambling-Linked-to-Lower-Grade-Point-Averages" class="headerlink" title="Athlete Gambling Linked to Lower Grade Point Averages"></a>Athlete Gambling Linked to Lower Grade Point Averages</h1><p>While some college athletes may gamble on sports out of boredom or to make some extra money, a new study has found that there may be another reason why they are gambling – their grades. According to the study, which was recently published in the journal “Addiction”, student-athletes who gamble on sports tend to have lower grade point averages than those who do not gamble.</p>
<p>For the study, researchers analyzed data from over 1,000 male and female student-athletes who were enrolled at colleges and universities in the United States. The participants were asked about their gambling behavior, including whether they had ever gambled on sports, how often they gambled, and how much money they typically gambled. The participants’ academic performance was also assessed, including their grade point averages.</p>
<p>The results of the study showed that student-athletes who gambled on sports had lower grade point averages than those who did not gamble. This was especially true for male student-athletes. Additionally, the study found that the more often a student-athlete gambled on sports, the lower their grade point average was likely to be.</p>
<p>There are several possible explanations for why student-athletes who gamble on sports tend to have lower grades. One is that gambling can lead to distraction and poor time management, which can negatively affect academic performance. Additionally, gambling may be a sign of other issues such as addiction or mental health problems, which can also interfere with academic success.</p>
<p>The findings of this study suggest that universities and colleges should consider implementing policies prohibiting or restricting gambling by student-athletes. In addition, coaches and athletics administrators should educate student-athletes about the risks associated with gambling and provide them with resources if they need help dealing with any gambling issues.</p>
<h1 id="Majority-of-College-Athletes-Believe-Peers-Gamble-on-Sports"><a href="#Majority-of-College-Athletes-Believe-Peers-Gamble-on-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Majority of College Athletes Believe Peers Gamble on Sports"></a>Majority of College Athletes Believe Peers Gamble on Sports</h1><p>A majority of college athletes believe their peers gamble on sports, according to a recent survey.</p>
<p>The poll, which was conducted by The Sporting News, asked more than 1,000 Division I and II athletes from around the country about their perceptions of gambling in college sports.</p>
<p>Almost 60 percent of those surveyed said they believe that at least some of their fellow student-athletes are betting on games. Just 2 percent of athletes polled said they believed that no one on their campus gambles on sports.</p>
<p>Gambling on sports is considered a violation of NCAA rules, and can lead to punishments for both the individual bettors and the schools involved. However, the survey suggests that gambling is still a widespread issue among college athletes.</p>
<p>“It’s not really a surprise,” said Charles Robinson, an investigative reporter who has covered NCAA corruption issues for Yahoo! Sports. “Gambling has been around college athletics as long as there have been college athletics. And with the amount of money at stake these days, it’s only going to get worse.”</p>
<p>The NCAA has taken steps in recent years to try to curtail gambling in college sports, including implementing new rules banning certain types of bets and increasing fines for violations. However, Robinson said that the organization faces an uphill battle in trying to stamp out the practice.</p>
<p>“The NCAA is always playing catch-up when it comes to gambling issues, because the casinos and bookmakers are always one step ahead,” Robinson said. “They have more money and more resources than the NCAA does, so it’s difficult for them to keep up.”</p>
<p>Many experts argue that rampant gambling in college sports creates an environment ripe for corruption and cheating. In recent years, there have been numerous high-profile cases of corruption involving student-athletes and coaches who have been caught violating NCAA rules related to gambling.</p>
<p>In some cases, players have intentionally attempted to throw games in order to win bets placed against their teams. Others have been accused of accepting money or gifts from gamblers in return for inside information about upcoming games.</p>
<p>While it is impossible to know how much gambling affects overall game outcomes, studies have shown that betting on collegiate sporting events can create Division I football and men’s basketball games with twice as many errors as normal. This can lead to teams winning or losing games that they should have otherwise won or lost – affecting both the players and fans who follow those teams.</p>
<h1 id="Gambler’s-remorse-Half-of-student-athletes-say-they-have-gambled-on-sports"><a href="#Gambler’s-remorse-Half-of-student-athletes-say-they-have-gambled-on-sports" class="headerlink" title="Gambler’s remorse? Half of student-athletes say they have gambled on sports"></a>Gambler’s remorse? Half of student-athletes say they have gambled on sports</h1><p>A new study by Ohio State University has found that almost half of college student-athletes have gambled on sports.</p>
<p>The study, which was published in the journal “ Sport, Exercise, and Performance Psychology “, surveyed 542 Division I athletes and found that 47.2% of them had gambled on sports at some point in their lives. The most common forms of gambling were wagering on individual games (29.5%), betting against a friend or teammate (23.9%), and playing casino games (22.8%).</p>
<p>The study also found that student-athletes who reported gambling were more likely to experience negative consequences such as anxiety (52.4%), sadness (40.2%), and frustration (32.5%). They were also more likely to feel guilty after gambling (51.4%) and to regret having gambled (49.1%).</p>
<p>These findings suggest that student-athletes need to be aware of the risks associated with gambling, and that there may be a need for gambling prevention programmes specifically tailored for this population.</p>
<h1 id="NCAA-Athletes-Who-Gamble-on-Games-Most-Likely-to-Cheat"><a href="#NCAA-Athletes-Who-Gamble-on-Games-Most-Likely-to-Cheat" class="headerlink" title="NCAA Athletes Who Gamble on Games Most Likely to Cheat"></a>NCAA Athletes Who Gamble on Games Most Likely to Cheat</h1><p>Athletes in the NCAA who gamble on games are more likely to cheat than those who don’t gamble. Gambling can create an incentive for athletes to fix games, and it can also lead to players taking performance-enhancing drugs in order to win.</p>
<p>In a study of nearly 2,000 NCAA athletes, researchers found that those who gambled on games were twice as likely to engage in cheating behavior, such as using banned substances or fixing results. The study was published in the journal “Frontiers in Psychology”.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Aaron P. Blasetti, said that the findings suggest that gambling may be “a red flag for potential cheating among student-athletes”. He added that “our findings suggest that gambling availability may increase the likelihood of cheating among college athletes”.</p>
<p>Gambling is widely available on college campuses, and it is often easy for students to bet on sports matches. This raises the risk that some student-athletes will be tempted to cheat in order to win money or improve their odds of winning.</p>
<p>There have been several high-profile cases of NCAA athletes who have been caught cheating after gambling on games. In 2010, three Miami Hurricanes football players were charged with providing false information to investigators about their involvement in a gambling ring. In 2017, five Oklahoma State University basketball players were suspended for one game after being caught betting on college basketball games.</p>
<p>The link between gambling and cheating is not limited to the NCAA; several professional athletes have also been caught cheating after gambling on sports matches. In 2013, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez was suspended for 211 games after being caught using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) as part of a gambling scheme. And in 2015, then-New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton was suspended for one year after his team was caught trying to manipulate game outcomes by targeting specific referees.</p>
<p>It is clear that gambling can create a strong temptation for athletes to cheat. This temptation must be avoided if we want college and professional sports to be fair and competitive. Athletes who gamble on games should be held accountable for their actions, and they should face serious penalties if they are caught cheating</p>
